# Welcome to the FIWARE IoT Agent for JSON

This Internet of Things Agent is a bridge that can be used to communicate devices using a simple JSON protocol and NGSI Context Brokers (like Orion). This protocol is based in simple single level JSON Objects codifying (attribute, value) pairs. This protocol is aimed for simplicity and ease of use, for those scenarios where there are no hard resource constraints.

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-json/blob/master/README.md) provides a good documentation summary.
The [User Manual](usermanual.md) and the [Admin Guide](installationguide.md) cover more advanced topics.
